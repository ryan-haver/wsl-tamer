# WSL Tamer - Product Roadmap

**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Executive Summary

WSL Tamer is positioned to become the premier WSL management solution by combining advanced features from competitor applications while maintaining a user-friendly interface. This roadmap outlines features that will meet or exceed current market offerings.

---

## Roadmap Prioritization Principles

**Core-First Approach:**

- **Earlier phases** focus on WSL fundamentals: installation, distribution lifecycle, snapshots, basic monitoring, and configuration management
- **Later phases** introduce expansions: IDE integrations, remote management, container orchestration, hypervisor support, and enterprise features
- **User impact priority:** Reliability, recoverability, and visibility for daily WSL workflows come before advanced integrations
- **Dependency awareness:** Foundational plumbing (snapshot engine, registry APIs, monitoring collectors) precede complex UI and remote features

**Phase Ordering Logic:**

1. **Core WSL** (Phases 0-1, 3): Install wizard, distro management, snapshots
2. **Essential monitoring** (Phase 5 subset): Resource visibility, process/port inspection before UI polish
3. **User experience** (Phases 2, 4): Tray integration, hotkeys, automation after core stability
4. **Advanced features** (Phases 5-8): Networking, packages, multimedia, hardware passthrough
5. **Ecosystem expansion** (Phases 9-13): IDE/browser plugins, remote/LAN, orchestration, hypervisors, enterprise security

## Architectural Considerations for Long-Term Vision

### Core Architecture Enhancements Needed

#### 1. **Abstraction Layer for Virtualization/Container Providers**

```csharp
// Provider abstraction
public interface IVirtualizationProvider
{
    string Name { get; }
    Task<List<IVirtualInstance>> ListInstancesAsync();
    Task<bool> StartInstanceAsync(string id);
    Task<bool> StopInstanceAsync(string id);
    Task<ResourceMetrics> GetResourceMetricsAsync(string id);
}

// Implementations
public class WslProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class HyperVProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class DockerProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class PodmanProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class KubernetesProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class VmwareProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class ProxmoxProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
public class CygwinProvider : IVirtualizationProvider { }
```text

#### 2. **REST API & WebSocket Server**

```csharp
// RESTful API for external integrations
// Endpoints:
//   GET  /api/v1/instances
//   POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/start
//   POST /api/v1/instances/{id}/stop
//   GET  /api/v1/instances/{id}/metrics
//   WS   /ws/v1/events (real-time updates)

// Authentication: JWT tokens, API keys, certificates
// Authorization: RBAC with scopes
// Rate limiting: Per-user, per-IP
```text

#### 3. **Plugin System**

```csharp
public interface IWslTamerPlugin
{
    string Name { get; }
    string Version { get; }
    Task InitializeAsync(IPluginContext context);
    Task<PluginResult> ExecuteAsync(PluginRequest request);
}

// Plugin discovery
// Plugin sandboxing
// Plugin permissions
// Plugin marketplace
```text

#### 4. **Remote Communication Layer**

```text
Client WSL Tamer ←→ gRPC/REST API ←→ Server WSL Tamer
- Mutual TLS authentication
- Command queue with retry
- Event streaming (WebSocket/gRPC streaming)
- Offline mode with sync on reconnect
- Peer-to-peer discovery (mDNS)
```text

#### 5. **Secrets Management Architecture**

```csharp
public interface ISecretsProvider
{
    Task<Secret> GetSecretAsync(string key);
    Task SetSecretAsync(string key, Secret value);
    Task<bool> RotateSecretAsync(string key);
    Task<List<SecretMetadata>> ListSecretsAsync();
}

// Implementations
public class WindowsDpapiProvider : ISecretsProvider { }
public class HashiCorpVaultProvider : ISecretsProvider { }
public class AzureKeyVaultProvider : ISecretsProvider { }
public class AwsSecretsManagerProvider : ISecretsProvider { }
```text

#### 6. **Data Model Evolution**

```csharp
// Current: WSL-specific models
public class Distribution { }

// Future: Generic instance model
public class VirtualInstance
{
    string Id { get; set; }
    string Name { get; set; }
    InstanceType Type { get; set; } // WSL, Docker, Hyper-V, etc.
    IVirtualizationProvider Provider { get; set; }
    ResourceConfiguration Resources { get; set; }
    List<ICapability> Capabilities { get; set; }
}

public enum InstanceType
{
    Wsl2,
    Docker,
    Podman,
    Kubernetes,
    HyperV,
    Vmware,
    Proxmox,
    Cygwin,
    Msys2
}
```text

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Current: distributions table

-- Future: Add tables for

CREATE TABLE virtual_instances (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'wsl', 'docker', 'hyperv', etc.
    provider_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    config_json TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE remote_machines (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    hostname TEXT NOT NULL,
    ip_address TEXT,
    connection_type TEXT, -- 'lan', 'vpn', 'wan'
    auth_method TEXT,
    certificate TEXT,
    last_seen DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE secrets (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    key TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    encrypted_value BLOB,
    provider TEXT,
    expires_at DATETIME,
    rotated_at DATETIME,
    accessed_at DATETIME
);
```text

### UI Architecture Evolution

```text
Current: Electron (C# WPF backend)

Phase 1-8: Continue with Electron
- Maintain current architecture
- Add REST API server in backend

Phase 9+: Hybrid architecture
- Desktop app: Electron (local management)
- Web app: React/Blazor (remote management)
- Mobile app: React Native (monitoring only)
- Browser extension: React + WebSocket
- IDE extensions: Provider-specific (TypeScript, Java, C#)

All share common REST API
