# WSL Tamer

**Tame the beast that is Windows Subsystem for Linux.**

WSL Tamer is a lightweight system tray application designed to give you full control over WSL2's resource usage. No more manually editing .wslconfig files or running PowerShell commands to shut down runaway instances.

## Features

### Smart Resource Profiles

Switch between profiles instantly without restarting Windows:

* **Eco Mode:** Caps RAM at 4GB, limits CPU. Great for background tasks or battery life.
* **Balanced:** The sweet spot (e.g., 8GB - 12GB). Perfect for daily development.
* **Unleashed:** Unlocks full system resources for heavy compilation or ML tasks.

### Automation & Triggers

* **Process Triggers:** Automatically switch profiles when you launch specific apps (e.g., switch to "Unleashed" when `code.exe` starts).
* **Power Triggers:** Automatically switch to "Eco Mode" when on battery power.

### Distro Management

* **Dashboard:** View all installed distributions and their running state.
* **Control:** Launch, Stop, or Set Default distributions directly from the UI.

### Quick Actions

* **Start Background:** Start WSL in headless mode (no terminal window) to keep background services running.
* **Start/Stop WSL:** One-click shutdown to free up resources immediately.
* **Reclaim Memory:** Force Linux to drop caches and return RAM to Windows.
* **Compact Disk:** Shrink the .vhdx virtual disk file to reclaim disk space.

### System Tray Integration

* **Dynamic Icon:** Visual indicator of WSL state (Green = Running, Gray = Stopped).
* **Right-click context menu:** For all actions.
* **Auto-start:** Option to start automatically with Windows.

## Tech Stack

* **Language:** C# / .NET 8 (WPF)
* **Integration:** Interacts directly with wsl.exe and ~/.wslconfig.
